# Coverage Baseline & Growth Plan

## Current baseline (S1–S2)
- **Overall instruction coverage:** 25% minimum (merged across modules).
- **Core domain instruction coverage:** 60% minimum (`:core-domain` only).

These thresholds are intentionally conservative to establish a reliable baseline while
we expand unit-test coverage across the feature modules.

## Target growth (S3+)
- **Overall instruction coverage target:** 40%+
- **Core domain instruction coverage target:** 75%+

Targets will be raised once additional unit-test suites land in `feature-*` modules.
